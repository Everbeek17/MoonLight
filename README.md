# MoonLight
A game about shooting stars around planets into grey circles.

You grab a nearby "star" and launch it with the aim of hitting the grey cicle (which is supposed to be a moon that needs some light, hence the name MoonLight) all the while every projectile is feeling the gravitational pull of all the planets on the screen, this affecting the flight path.
Go into the level editor to make your own levels to test with as the only level in the game right now is just a level to test how strong the physics engine is.

Like the majority of the games I've made so far, this one isnt' complete, but it's the most "complete" one I've made so far!
Has a working Level Editor and all the physics seems to be working correctly (except for the intense amount of errors thrown into the console everytime objects start flying around... But it's ok because somehow the entire game still works even with the error.)
I learned a lot about physics engines in general, as well as how to make my own decently efficient.
